## **Challenges of Functional Programming**

- Multiple team members didn’t follow the consistency & convention
- Huge Duplicate codes
- Unmanageable & growth code structure
- Harder to debug & easy introduce new bugs

## **Why OOP?**

- Because function can’t be extended but Class do. The idea was very simple. Put all the main task or repetitive task inside a class & extend it whenever necessary. Developer should only focus on the writing the business logic.

## **What OOP offers?**

### **Technical Terms**

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

### **General Terms**

- It provides extensibility
- It encapsulate all the related things in a isolated boundary. So that people won’t have any freaking idea what is going inside.
- It provides abstractions to that people don’t need to know the implementation details.
- OOP has a lot of design patterns already solved common problems.
- We can apply all the design pattern in OOP with out having any workaround.

### **What will you achieve?**

End of the day

- It provide structure of your application
- Minimize the code you should write
- Forcefully applied visual guideline that how to code
- And it make sure that no one can produce garbage code.

## **Class**

- Classes are blueprints for creating objects
- Class is container that holds states and methods
- Class can share states between multiple methods
- The state is called property

### **When to use Class**

- When modeling entities with both data (properties) and actions (methods)
- When multiple instances with similar behavior are needed
- When we need inheritance
- When we need to protect the data
